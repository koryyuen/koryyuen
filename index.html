                    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Kory Yuen (he/him)</strong>. I'm from San Gabriel, CA and I'm a <strong>second-year</strong> Computer Engineering student. 
                    I'm <strong>extremely passionate</strong> about helping others through tech while learning new things about tech.<br>This year, I hope to gain some professional 
                    experience and try to get an internship. A fun fact about me is that I'm left-handed. Some hobbies I have are playing video games, going to the gym, and 
                    watching sports (mainly basketball and football).
